# Psychic-Game
<html>
The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.
<br>
Following text will be displayed on the screen - 
<br>
a) Guess what letter I'm thinking of
b) Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
c) Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
d) Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
e) Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
<br>
When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
<br>
When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
